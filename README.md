# quality-bot

A health-check bot for the quality of services.
This bot was written in about 4 days for an internship application assessment. There is no actual service or product so the reviews/issues are of course not related to any certain thing, they are just some sort of a proof of concept. Though the all responses are actually stored locally.

This was also a first for me with both Typescript and Docker, has been nice experimenting with new stuff though.
_So I've decided to skip Docker, don't have the energy to configure it._

## Project Setup

The app requires a `BOT_TOKEN` to be provided in `.env`. The token can be taken from **@BotFather** on Telegram.

### Install

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run dev
```

### Compiles for production

```
npm run build
```

### Run the production build

```
npm run start
```

**Please note that the production build may currently have some issues, better to try the dev build**
